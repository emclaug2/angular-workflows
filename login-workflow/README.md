# Angular Auth Workflow 
![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow)

The Angular Auth Workflow package provides a consistent authentication and registration experience across Eaton web applications using Angular. 

This includes pre-built implementations of the screens for Login, Forgot Password, Self-Registration, Contact Support, Registration By Invitation, and a dialog for Change Password.

This documentation explains the steps required to integrate this auth workflow into your application.

# Managing State

After setup, you are now able to access various security actions and state from within your application.  

## PxbAuthSecurityService 

`PxbAuthSecurityService` is a service used to store authentication state.  Pages with the auth workflow will look to this service for information about a current user and their authentication state. 

### Usage 

```
import { PxbAuthSecurityService, AUTH_ROUTE } from '@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow';

constructor(private readonly _pxbSecurityService: PxbAuthSecurityService) {}

logout(): void {
   this._pxbSecurityService.updateSecurityState({ isAuthenticatedUser: false });
   void this._router.navigate([AUTH_ROUTE]);
}
```

## PxbAuthConfig

`PxbAuthConfig` a configuration service; it is used to enable/disable settings in the auth workflow. These properties are typically set only once and do not change. Some UI configuration properties are also passed in.

### Usage

```
import { PxbAuthConfig } from '@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow';

constructor(pxbAuthConfig: PxbAuthConfig) {
    pxbAuthConfig.projectImage = 'assets/images/eaton_stacked_logo.png';
    pxbAuthConfig.backgroundImage = 'assets/images/background.svg';
    pxbAuthConfig.allowDebugMode = true;
    pxbAuthConfig.showSelfRegistration = false;
}
```

# Services

This document outlines the various exports and configuration options for the workflow package.

## PxbAuthSecurityService

`PxbAuthSecurityService` provides user authentication state and updates as a user logs in/out. Pages within the workflow use this service for info about whether or not a user is authenticated, check if an API call is happening, etc.  It is not meant to authenticate the user or hold credential information. 

### Usage

```ts
import { PxbAuthSecurityService, AUTH_ROUTE } from '@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow';

constructor(private readonly _pxbSecurityService: PxbAuthSecurityService) {}

logout(): void {
   this._pxbSecurityService.updateSecurityState({ isAuthenticatedUser: false });
   void this._router.navigate([AUTH_ROUTE]);
}
```

### Methods

-   **getSecurityState**: _`SecurityContext`_
    -   Returns current security state
-   **updateSecurityState(newState: SecurityContext)**: _`void`_
    -   Accepts any new state prop and applies to the the current state.
-   **securityStateChanges**: _`Observable<SecurityContext>`_
    -   An observable that emits when the security state changes
-   **onUserAuthenticated**: _`void`_
    -   Should be called when a user authenticates; updates state accordingly.
-   **onUserNotAuthenticated**: _`Observable<SecurityContext>`_
    -   Should be called when the user is no longer authenticated; updates state accordingly. 

## SecurityContext

`SecurityContext` retains user-provided state information.

### Type Declaration

-   **email**: _`string`_
    -   UserId of the authenticated user (may be an email).
-   **userId**: _`string`_
    -   Information for a user who wants to be remembered upon logout.
-   **rememberMeDetails**: _`{ email: string; rememberMe: boolean }`_
    -   Email and Remember Me state provided when a user logs in.
-   **isLoading**: _`boolean`_
    -   Loading indicator when performing API calls.
-   **isAuthenticatedUser**: _`boolean`_
    -   Whether the user has logged in or is otherwise authenticated.
    
    
## PxbChangePasswordDialogService

The Change Password page is the only page in the auth workflow that is accessible via a dialog box and not an angular route. 
When a password is changed, the dialog box will be dismissed automatically. To show the Change Password dialog, see the usage below. 
    
### Usage

```
import { PxbChangePasswordDialogService } from '@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow';

constructor(public readonly _pxbChangePasswordService: PxbChangePasswordDialogService) {}

openDialog() {
    this._pxbChangePasswordService.openDialog();
}
```

## PxbAuthUIService

`PxbAuthUIService` contains methods that are intended to call APIs to perform auth-related actions.  A mock `PxbAuthUIService` is provided in the examples folder to provide a placeholder for API calls.

### Usage

You will need to provide your own service implementation with real API calls.

```
// app.module.ts
import { PxbAuthUIService } from '@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow';
import { AuthUIService } from 'services/auth-ui.service';

providers: [
    {
        provide: PxbAuthUIService,
        useClass: AuthUIService,
    }
]
```

### Methods

-   **changePassword**: _`(oldPassword: string, newPassword: string): Promise<void>`_

    -   An authenticated user wants to change their password. The application should try to change the user's password. Upon completion, the user will be logged out of the application. Upon cancellation, the user will be taken back to the application's home screen.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   **oldPassword**: _`string`_
            -   The user's current password as entered into the UI.
        -   **newPassword**: _`string`_
            -   The user's new password as entered into the UI.

-   **forgotPassword**: _`(email: string): Promise<void>`_

    -   The user has forgotten their password and wants help. The application generally should call an API which will then send a password reset link to the user's email.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   **email**: _`string`_
            -   Email address the user uses to log in to the application.

-   **initiateSecurity**: _`() => Promise<void>`_

    -   Initialize the application security state. This will involve reading any local storage, validating existing credentials (token expiration, for example). At the end of validation, the SecurityContextActions should be called with either: onUserAuthenticated (which will present the application), or onUserNotAuthenticated (which will present the Auth UI).
    -   Should always resolve, never throw.
        > Note: Until this method returns, the applications Splash screen will be presented.

-   **login**: _`(email: string, password: string, rememberMe: boolean): Promise<void>`_

    -   The user wants to log into the application. Perform a login with the user's credentials. The application should provide the user's email and password to the authentication server.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   **email**: _`string`_
            -   Email address the user entered into the UI.
        -   **password**: _`string`_
            -   Password the user entered into the UI.
        -   **rememberMe**: _`boolean`_
            -   Indicates whether the user's email should be remembered on success.

-   **setPassword**: _`(password: string) => Promise<void>`_

    -   A user who has previously used "forgotPassword" now has a valid password reset link and has entered a new password. The application should take the user's newly entered password and then reset the user's current password.

        > Note: Upon success, the user will be taken to the Login screen

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   **password**: _`string`_
            -   New Password the user entered into the UI

-   **verifyResetCode**: _`() => Promise<void>`_

    -   The user has tapped on an email with a password reset link, which they received after requesting help for forgetting their password. This API call validates the reset link is legitimate and the app should allow a user to enter a new password. 

## PxbRegisterUIService

`PxbAuthUIService` contains methods that are intended to call APIs to perform registration-related actions. A mock `PxbRegistrerUIService` is provided in the examples folder to provide a placeholder for API calls.

### Usage

You will need to provide your own service implementation with real API calls.

```
// app.module.ts
import { PxbRegisterUIService } from '@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow';
import { RegisterUIService } from 'services/register-ui.service';

providers: [
    {
        provide: PxbRegisterUIService,
        useClass: RegisterUIService,
    }
]
```

### Methods

-   **completeRegistration**: _`(firstName: string, lastName: string, phoneNumber: string, password: string, validationCode?: string, email?: string: Promise<void>`_

    -   The user has been invited to register and has entered the necessary account and password information. The application should now complete the registration process given the user's data.

        > Note: Upon resolution, the user will be brought back to the Login screen.

    -   **Parameters**:
        -   **firstName**: _`string`_
            -   User's first name.
        -   **lastName**: _`string`_
            -   User's last name.
        -   **phoneNumber**: _`phoneNumber`_
            -   User-provided phoneNumber; may be undefined.

            -   User's requested account password.
        -   **validationCode**: (optional) _`string`_
            -   Code used to validate if a user's account registration link was valid.
        -   **email**: (optional) _`string`_
            -   User-provided email when creating a new account via `/auth/create-account`.

-   **loadEULA**: _`(): Promise<string>`_

    -   The user wants to complete an action but must first accept the EULA. The application should retrieve an application-specific EULA for the user.
    
    -   **Returns**: _`Promise<string>`_
        -   Resolve with EULA, otherwise reject with an error message.

-   **requestRegistrationCode**: _`(email: string): Promise<void>`_

    -   The user entered their email address and accepted the EULA. The API should now send them an email with the validation code.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   **email**: _`string`_
            -   The email address for the registering user.

-   **validateUserRegistrationRequest**: _`(code: string) => Promise<boolean>`_

    -   The user has been sent a verification code to an email they have provided; validate the verification code has been received to continue account registration.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   **code**: _`string`_
            -   Registration code provided from the link.



# Error Handling

Each `PxbRegisterUIService` and `PxbAuthUIService` API call has a default error message that a user will see when an API call fails.  Each error message can be customized by rejecting a promise with an `ErrorDialogData` object.

## Custom Error Title or Message

Rejecting an API call with an `ErrorDialogData` object allows for custom Dialog titles and message content to be display.

```
export type ErrorDialogData = {
    title: string;
    message: string;
}
```

```
changePassword(oldPassword: string, newPassword: string): Promise<void> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (/*fail scenario*/)
            return reject({
                title: 'Error!',
                message: 'This is an example of a custom error message.',
            });
        }
        return resolve();
    }
}
```

## Custom Error Content

In situations where more a complex error dialog is needed (e.g contains a link or images) users can use their own error dialog components.

The example project demos this feature for the login screen; whenever an error happens, we show a custom user-provided dialog component.

To provide your own dialog component, replace the default page-specific `ErrorDialogService` with your own service that will display your custom dialog.

```
// app.module.ts
import { PxbLoginErrorDialogService } from '@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow';
import { LoginErrorDialogService } from 'dialog/login-error-dialog.service';

providers: [
    {
        provide: PxbLoginErrorDialogService,
        useClass: LoginErrorDialogService,
    }
]
```

To enforce type-safety, your `ErrorDialogService` should implement `IPxbAuthErrorDialogService`.

```
import { IPxbAuthErrorDialogService } from '@pxblue/angular-auth-workflow';

@Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root',
})
export class LoginErrorDialogService implements IPxbAuthErrorDialogService {
    constructor(private dialog: MatDialog) {}
    openDialog(): MatDialogRef<[YourDialogComponent]> {
        return this.dialog.open([YourDialogComponent], {
            disableClose: false,
        });
    }
}
```

See the example project (`./src/app/dialog/login-error-dialog.component.ts`) for an example of a custom ErrorDialog component.
